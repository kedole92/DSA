Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
Input format
Line 1: Number of Test cases (T)
Line 2 to X: First Test Case binary tree structure (refer section below for the format)
Line X+1 to Y: Second Test Case details and so on.

Output format
For each test case, print N (number of nodes in the tree) space separated values of next nodes on a separate line. If nothing exists in the next print "null" without quotes.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= Value of nodes <= 10^9
It is guaranteed that the sum of the number of tree nodes across all test cases will be less than 500000.

Sample Input 1
1
3
1 2 3
1 2 3
2 -1 -1
3 -1 -1

Sample Output 1
Yes

Explanation 1
For each node the difference of depth of left subtree and right subtree is less than equal to 1 so the tree is balanced.

Sample Input 2
1
3
1 2 3
1 2 -1
2 3 -1
3 -1 -1

Sample Output 2
No

Explanation 2
Node(1) has depth of the left subtree is 2 and depth of right subtree is 0 hence the tree is unbalanced.

Instructions to create custom input for a Binary Tree
In order to specify a binary tree that can be used as custom input to the problem, youâ€™ll need to follow this convention.

Line 1: Number of nodes in the Binary Tree (N)

Line 2: N space separated node values. The position of the Nodes on this line will be used to refer to them in the below lines, starting from 1.

Line 3 to N+2: Lines specifying the child nodes for each of the N nodes

Format of each line (space separated): Parent_node Left_child_node Right_child_node




class TreeNode {
public:
    long val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode* next;
    TreeNode (long x) {
        val = x;
        left = NULL;
        right = NULL;
        next = NULL;
    }
*/
class CheckBalanced {
public:
    static int checkHeight(TreeNode* root)
    {
        if(!root)
            return 0;

        int left = checkHeight(root->left);
        if(left == -1)  return -1;

        int right = checkHeight(root->right);
        if(right == -1) return -1;

        if(abs(left-right) > 1) return -1;

        return 1+max(left,right);
    }

    bool checkBalanced(TreeNode *root)
    {
        return checkHeight(root) != -1;
    }
};
